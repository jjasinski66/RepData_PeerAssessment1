Daily Total Number of Steps taken Daily are...
```{r}
sub <- subset(data, !is.na(steps))
sub$date <- as.POSIXct(sub$date,  format="%Y-%m-%d")
table <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = sub, sum )
hist(table$steps, col = "blue", main = "Total Steps Taken Daily", ylab = "Percentage", xlab = "Total Steps")
```

Mean and Median of steps taken...
```{r}
steps <- table$steps
mean(steps)
median(steps)
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
##hist(sub, col = 'red', main = "Daily Activity", xlab = "Date")
